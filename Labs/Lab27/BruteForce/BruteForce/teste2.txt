Computer science is the scientific and practical approach to computation and 
its applications. It is the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, 
expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) 
that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication 
of, and access to information, whether such information is encoded as bits in a 
computer memory or transcribed in genes and protein structures in a biological 
cell. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of 
automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in 
the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.
